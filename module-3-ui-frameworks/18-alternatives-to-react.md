# Alternatives and Companion Libraries to React

## Overview

React is a **library**, not a full framework. This means it is commonly used alongside other JavaScript libraries to handle tasks such as state management, data fetching, utilities, and testing.

Below are some widely used JavaScript libraries that are often used with React applications.

---

## Lodash

* Utility library that provides commonly used functions
* Helps avoid rewriting common logic

### Common Use Cases

* Sorting lists
* Rounding numbers
* Manipulating arrays and objects

**Benefit:** Saves development time by providing reliable, well-tested utility functions

---

## Luxon

* Library for working with **dates and times**
* Designed as a modern replacement for older date libraries

### Common Use Cases

* Formatting dates based on locale
* Handling time zones
* Displaying calendars and schedules

**Example:**

* US format: Month / Day / Year
* European format: Day / Month / Year

**Benefit:** Simplifies complex date and time handling

---

## Redux

* State management library
* Helps manage and centralize application state

### Common Use Cases

* Shopping carts
* User authentication state
* Application-wide data sharing

### Features

* Predictable state updates
* Supports advanced features like **undo** and **redo**

**Benefit:** Makes state changes easier to track and debug in large applications

---

## Axios

* HTTP client library
* Simplifies communication with APIs

### Common Use Cases

* Sending GET and POST requests
* Fetching data from servers
* Submitting form data

### Features

* Request cancellation
* Automatic JSON handling
* Request and response transformation

**Benefit:** Cleaner and more powerful alternative to native fetch

---

## Jest

* JavaScript testing framework
* Commonly used for testing React applications

### Features

* Automated unit and integration testing
* Snapshot testing
* Code coverage reports

**Benefit:** Helps ensure code quality and reliability through automated tests

## Conclusion

React applications are often built using an ecosystem of supporting libraries. Each library serves a specific purpose, from utilities and state management to API communication and testing.

Exploring these tools and understanding when to use them will help you build scalable, maintainable, and professional React applications.
