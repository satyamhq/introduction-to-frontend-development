# What Are Websites and Webpages?

## Introduction

You may have heard the terms **webpage** and **website**, but what is the difference between them?

A **webpage** is a single document displayed in a web browser.  
A **website** is a collection of webpages that are linked together and usually share the same domain name.

Understanding this difference is essential for anyone learning web development.

## What Is a Webpage?

A **webpage** is a document that can display:
- Text
- Images
- Videos
- Audio
- Other multimedia content

Webpages are viewed using a web browser and are written using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What Is a Website?

A **website** is a collection of related webpages that are connected through links.

For example:
- A homepage usually links to multiple articles or sections
- Each article is a separate webpage
- All these webpages together form a website

If multiple webpages share a similar web address (URL), it is safe to assume they belong to the same website.

## Linking Between Websites

Not all links on a webpage need to point to the same website.

Examples:
- A search engine displays links to many different websites
- A webpage can link to external websites for references or resources

This interlinking is what makes the web a connected system.

## Growth of the Web

Thousands of new websites are launched every day.

To put this into perspective:
- Hundreds of thousands of websites are created daily
- In one week, the number of new webpages rivals the number of stones used to build the Great Pyramid of Giza

With current internet speeds, it would take millions of years to download every webpage on the internet.

Despite their variety, all webpages rely on the same core technologies.

## Core Technologies of a Webpage

At its most basic level, a webpage is a **text document** that can be opened and edited with any text editor.

However, modern webpages rely on three core technologies:

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML defines the **structure and content** of a webpage.

It uses markup tags to describe:
- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Images
- Audio and video elements

This process of describing content is known as **markup**.

---

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS controls the **appearance and layout** of a webpage.

It is responsible for:
- Colors
- Fonts
- Spacing
- Page layout

CSS enhances HTML elements and determines how they are displayed on the screen.

---

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language built into the browser.

It adds **interactivity and behavior** to webpages, such as:
- Form validation
- Real-time content updates
- User interactions

Without JavaScript, websites would be static and very limited in functionality.

## How a Webpage Appears on Your Screen

When a webpage is requested:
1. The web server sends the webpage code to the browser
2. The browser reads the code line by line
3. The browser builds the visual elements on the screen

This process is known as **page rendering**.

To display a webpage correctly, the server must send a complete response containing all required content.

## Conclusion

In summary:
- A webpage is a single document viewed in a browser
- A website is a collection of linked webpages
- Webpages are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Browsers render webpage code to display content visually
- Modern web developers continuously build and expand the internet

Understanding these fundamentals is the first step toward becoming a web developer.
