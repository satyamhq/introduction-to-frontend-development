# Developer Tools

Just like opening the hood of a car to diagnose an engine problem, developers can “open the hood” of a web page to inspect and debug front-end issues. Modern web browsers provide **developer tools** that allow you to inspect code, trace network activity, analyze performance, and review security details.

By using developer tools, you can investigate not only your own code but also understand how other websites are built.

## What Are Developer Tools?

Most web browsers include built-in developer tools that allow developers to:

- Inspect HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Debug JavaScript errors
- Trace HTTP requests and responses
- Analyze performance and memory usage
- Review security-related details

These tools are essential for diagnosing and fixing front-end issues.

## Opening Developer Tools

In **Google Chrome**, developer tools can be opened using any of the following methods:

- **Windows / Linux**: Press `F12`
- **macOS**: Press `Command + Option + J`
- **Right-click** on the page and select **Inspect**

Once opened, the developer tools panel appears with multiple tabs, each serving a different purpose.

## Common Developer Tools Tabs

### Console

- Displays JavaScript logs, warnings, and errors
- Useful for debugging JavaScript issues
- Shows output from `console.log()` statements

---

### Sources

- Displays all files loaded by the page
- Includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos
- Allows you to view and debug source files

---

### Network

- Shows all HTTP requests and responses
- Displays request timing, headers, payloads, and responses
- Useful for debugging API calls and loading issues

---

### Performance

- Shows what the browser is doing over time
- Helps identify slow functions and rendering issues
- Useful when a web application feels slow or unresponsive

---

### Memory

- Displays memory usage by your application
- Helps detect memory leaks
- Useful for optimizing resource usage

---

### Elements

- Allows inspection of the HTML document structure
- Shows DOM elements and their attributes
- Highlights elements in the browser when hovered
- Displays applied CSS styles and layout details

This is one of the most frequently used tabs.

---

## Inspecting and Editing Elements

When you click on an HTML element in the **Elements** tab:

- The corresponding element is highlighted on the page
- Applied CSS rules are shown on the side panel
- You can view computed styles and layout information

### Live Editing

- Double-clicking an HTML element allows you to edit it directly
- Changes apply only locally in your browser
- Reloading the page resets all changes

For example:
- Changing a menu item from **Chicken Burger** to **Turkey Burger**
- The change is visible only while the page is open

This feature is useful for testing layout and content changes quickly.

## Why Developer Tools Are Important

Developer tools help you:

- Debug front-end issues efficiently
- Understand how web pages are structured
- Analyze performance bottlenecks
- Inspect network activity
- Experiment safely without affecting the server

They are an essential part of every web developer’s toolkit.

## Summary

- Developer tools let you inspect and debug web pages
- They are built into modern web browsers
- Tabs provide access to code, network, performance, and memory data
- The Elements tab allows live inspection and editing
- Changes made in developer tools are temporary

Mastering developer tools is a key skill for front-end development.
