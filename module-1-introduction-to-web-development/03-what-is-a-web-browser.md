# What Is a Web Browser and How Does It Work?

## Introduction

You use a web browser every day on your devices, whether to search the web, watch videos, or read articles.  
But how does a web browser actually work?

A **web browser** is a software application that allows users to access and interact with content on the World Wide Web.

## What Is a Web Browser?

A web browser (or browser) is a program used to browse websites on the internet.

It works by:
1. Sending a request to a web server
2. Receiving a response containing webpage content
3. Displaying that content on your device screen

Examples of web browsers include those used on computers, tablets, and mobile phones.

## The Address Bar and URLs

Once a browser is open, you can type a website address into the **address bar**.

This address is called a **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**.

A URL contains:
- **Protocol** (such as HTTP or HTTPS)
- **Domain name** (the website name)
- **File path** (the specific page being requested)

The browser uses this information to locate and request the correct webpage.

## Browser and Server Communication

When a browser makes a request using a URL, it communicates with the web server using a protocol called **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**.

This communication happens through the **request–response cycle**:
1. The browser sends a request
2. The server processes the request
3. The server sends a response back to the browser

Once the browser receives the response, it displays the content on the screen.

## Example: Searching the Web

To understand this process better, consider a common example:

1. You open a web browser
2. You type the name of a search engine and press Enter
3. The browser sends a request to the search engine’s web server
4. The web server responds with a webpage
5. The browser renders the webpage and displays it

The webpage is a coded document that the browser interprets and presents visually to the user.

## Processing User Actions

After the search engine webpage loads, you interact with it.

For example:
- You type “restaurants near me”
- You click the search button

The browser sends another request to the same web server, this time including search instructions.

The web server:
- Processes the request
- Retrieves data from a connected **database**
- Sends the results back to the browser

The browser then renders a new webpage showing maps, links, reviews, and related information.

## Rendering Webpages

When the browser receives content from a server, it:
- Reads the code line by line
- Processes the instructions in sequence
- Builds the visual layout shown on the screen

This process is called **page rendering**.

Rendering allows raw code to become the interactive webpages users see and interact with.

## Where Else This Happens

The request–response cycle is not limited to searching the web.

It also occurs when:
- Sending messages
- Streaming videos
- Uploading or downloading files
- Using online applications

All these actions rely on browsers communicating with servers.

## Conclusion

In summary:
- A web browser is a software application used to access the web
- It sends requests to web servers using URLs
- Servers respond with webpage content
- Browsers render that content visually
- This interaction is powered by the request–response cycle

Understanding how browsers work helps explain how the internet delivers information so quickly and efficiently.
