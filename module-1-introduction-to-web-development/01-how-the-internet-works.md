# How the Internet Works

## Introduction

Have you ever searched for something online and received results almost instantly?  
It may seem simple on the surface, but a lot happens behind the scenes to make this possible.

This document explains the **basic working of the Internet** in a simple and easy-to-understand way.

## What Is a Network?

When you open an app or website on your device, you connect to other devices using a **wired or wireless connection**.  
This connection between devices is called a **network**.

A network allows devices to:
- Communicate with each other
- Share data
- Access online services

## Network Switches

As the number of connected devices increases, direct connections between all devices become inefficient.

This problem is solved using a **network switch**.

A network switch:
- Connects multiple devices
- Controls data flow between them
- Reduces unnecessary connections

Network switches can also connect to **other switches**, allowing multiple networks to join together.

## The Internet

When many networks connect together, they form an **interconnected network**.

This interconnected network is called the **Internet**.

The Internet is a global system that connects millions of networks and devices worldwide.

## Client–Server Model

Most Internet services work using the **client–server model**.

- **Client**: User devices like phones, laptops, or tablets
- **Server**: Powerful computers that store and provide data

Clients send requests, and servers respond with information such as:
- Web pages
- Videos
- Images
- Files

## Global Connectivity

The Internet connects people across the globe.

Data travels through:
- High-speed networks
- **Undersea fiber-optic cables**
- Satellites and data centers

These systems allow real-time communication, such as video calls between people on different continents.

## Conclusion

In simple terms:
- Devices form networks
- Networks connect with other networks
- Servers provide data to clients
- Physical infrastructure connects the world

This is the basic idea of **how the Internet works**.
