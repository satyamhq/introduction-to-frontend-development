# APIs and Services

Every day, people access information online by reading news, shopping, or communicating on social media. Behind the scenes, much of this information exchange is made possible through **APIs**.

As a web developer, you will work with APIs frequently. They are developer-friendly, widely used, and an essential part of modern web development.

---

## What Is an API?

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**.

An API is a set of functions and procedures that allow applications to:
- Access data
- Use features of an operating system
- Communicate with other applications or services

The term API is intentionally broad because it applies to many use cases and systems.

---

## Why APIs Are Important

In software development, APIs often act as a **bridge** between systems or components.

Because of this role, APIs are sometimes referred to as:
- Gateways
- Middleware

They allow different systems to communicate without needing to understand each other’s internal implementation.

---

## Common Types of APIs

Web developers commonly work with several types of APIs, including:
- Browser (Web) APIs
- RESTful APIs
- Sensor-Based APIs

Each type serves a different purpose.

---

## Browser (Web) APIs

Browser APIs are built directly into web browsers.  
They extend browser functionality and simplify complex tasks.

### Common Browser API Examples

- **DOM API**
  - Converts an HTML document into a tree of nodes
  - Nodes are represented as JavaScript objects
  - Enables dynamic manipulation of web pages

- **Geolocation API**
  - Provides the geographic location of the browser

- **Fetch API**
  - Used to request data from servers

- **Canvas API**
  - Used for drawing graphics and animations

- **History API**
  - Manages browser session history

- **Web Storage API**
  - Stores data on the client side

Browser APIs help developers build advanced features with simple, consistent syntax.

## RESTful APIs

One of the most important API types for web developers is the **RESTful API**.

### What Is REST?

REST stands for **Representational State Transfer**.

It is a set of principles used to design efficient and scalable APIs.

### Purpose of RESTful APIs

- Send and receive data
- Communicate with centralized databases
- Power web and mobile applications

REST APIs can be:
- Owned and maintained by your application
- Provided by third-party services

---

## RESTful API Operations

RESTful APIs commonly support the following operations:

| HTTP Method | Purpose             |
|------------|---------------------|
| GET        | Retrieve data       |
| POST       | Create data         |
| PUT        | Update data         |
| DELETE     | Remove data         |

These operations allow full interaction with application data.

---

## API Endpoints

REST APIs expose **endpoints** that define how resources can be accessed.

- Endpoints are part of the API URL
- Each endpoint represents a specific resource or action
- When an endpoint is accessed, the API processes the request and returns a response

### Common Response Types

- Full web pages
- Data formats such as **JSON**

---

## Sensor-Based APIs

Sensor-Based APIs are commonly used in the **Internet of Things (IoT)**.

They allow physical devices and sensors to communicate via APIs.

### Examples

- Smart lighting systems (e.g., Philips Hue)
- Robotics platforms
- Connected devices that track physical data

These APIs enable systems to respond to real-world conditions.

## APIs in Web Development

For most web developers:
- RESTful APIs are the most commonly used
- APIs act as the data backbone for web pages and mobile apps
- APIs extend system capabilities and connect components

Good API design follows REST principles to create:
- Predictable interfaces
- Discoverable endpoints
- Reliable responses

---

## Summary

- APIs enable communication between systems
- They act as bridges or gateways
- Browser APIs extend browser functionality
- RESTful APIs provide data to web and mobile apps
- Sensor-Based APIs support IoT systems
- APIs help developers build scalable, efficient applications

APIs are a core part of modern web development and are used daily by developers to build powerful and connected applications.
