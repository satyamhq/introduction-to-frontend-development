# Exploring Internet Protocols Through Command-Line Tools

## Introduction

This hands-on lab provides practical experience with **Internet protocols**, focusing on IP addressing and packet transmission.

Using the `ping` command in the terminal, you will observe how a domain name such as `github.com` resolves to an IP address and analyze packet transmission statistics like latency and packet loss.

---

## Goal

To understand the relationship between URLs and IP addresses, observe data packet flow, and interpret basic network statistics using command-line tools.

## Objectives

By completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Understand the purpose of the `ping` command
- Resolve a domain name to its corresponding IP address using DNS
- Observe and interpret packet transmission statistics
- Analyze latency, packet loss, and Time-to-Live (TTL) values
