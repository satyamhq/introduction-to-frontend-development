## Web Pages

A **web page** is a single document displayed in a web browser.

Key characteristics:
- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Displays text, images, videos, and other content
- Exists as one individual page

A web page can function on its own, but it often links to other pages.

## Websites

A **website** is a collection of related web pages connected under a single domain name.

Examples:
- A homepage with links to articles
- Article pages linking to other articles
- Multiple pages sharing the same domain

All these pages together form a website.

### Hyperlinks

- The links between pages are called **hyperlinks**
- Hyperlinks connect hypertext content
- HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**
- Links can point to:
  - Pages within the same website
  - Pages on different websites

Search engine results are a common example of hyperlinks pointing to external websites.

## Web Applications

A **web application** goes beyond displaying static information.

The key difference between a website and a web application is:
- **Interactivity**
- **Dynamic content**

### How Web Applications Work

- Content changes based on user input
- Data is processed in real time
- Users can perform actions such as:
  - Logging in
  - Ordering food
  - Submitting forms
  - Updating personal information

## Website vs Web Application

A simple way to remember the difference:

- **Website** → Informational

**Food Ordering Web Application**
- Content is specific to the user
- Shows menus, locations, and order history
- Responds to user actions and input

## Summary

- A **web page** is a single page
- A **website** is a collection of web pages under one domain

Understanding these differences helps developers decide what type of solution to build.
