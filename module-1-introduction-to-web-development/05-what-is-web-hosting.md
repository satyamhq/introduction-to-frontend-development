# What Is Web Hosting?

## Introduction

By now, you know that websites and files are stored on web servers located in data centers.

**Web hosting** is a service that allows individuals and organizations to place their website files on a hosting provider’s web server.

## Types of Web Hosting

There are several types of web hosting services, each designed for different needs and budgets.

### Shared Hosting

Shared hosting is the most affordable form of web hosting.

With shared hosting:
- Multiple websites share the same server
- CPU, memory, and bandwidth are shared among users
- Performance may be affected by other websites on the server

This option is best suited for:
- Small websites
- Personal projects
- Practice and learning environments

Some providers offer free shared hosting, often with limitations and advertisements.

### Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting

A **Virtual Private Server (VPS)** provides dedicated resources within a shared physical server.

With VPS hosting:
- CPU, memory, and bandwidth are allocated per VPS instance
- Performance is more stable than shared hosting
- Other VPS instances do not significantly affect your website

VPS hosting is more expensive than shared hosting and is suitable for growing websites.

### Dedicated Hosting

Dedicated hosting provides an entire physical server for your use.

With dedicated hosting:
- All hardware resources belong to you
- You have full control over server configuration
- Performance is high and consistent

This option is typically more expensive than VPS hosting and is used for large or high-traffic websites.

### Cloud Hosting

Cloud hosting runs websites in a **cloud environment** that spans multiple physical and virtual servers.

Key features of cloud hosting:
- Automatic failover if a server goes offline
- High availability and reliability
- No fixed hardware limitations

Cloud hosting uses a **pay-as-you-use** pricing model, meaning you are charged based on resource usage such as storage and bandwidth.

This model allows websites and applications to scale efficiently as demand increases.

## Why Cloud Hosting Is Popular

Cloud hosting has grown rapidly in popularity because it:
- Supports large-scale web applications
- Handles traffic spikes effectively
- Allows flexible cost scaling

Many modern web applications rely on cloud hosting to remain fast and available worldwide.
