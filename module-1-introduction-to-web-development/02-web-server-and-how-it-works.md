# What Is a Web Server and How Does It Work?

## Introduction

A **server** is a computer that runs applications and services such as websites, email systems, and instant messaging platforms.  
It is called a server because it **provides services** to another computer and its user, known as the **client**.

Web servers play a critical role in delivering website content quickly and reliably to users across the internet.

## Where Are Servers Located?

Servers are typically stored in facilities called **data centers**.

A data center:
- Contains hundreds or thousands of servers
- Provides continuous power supply
- Maintains constant internet connectivity
- Keeps servers running 24 hours a day

Data centers are located all around the world. Many websites use multiple data centers so users can access content from the **nearest location**, improving speed and performance.

## Server Hardware

Servers are built based on the service they provide.

Examples:
- A server used for storing images may have large storage capacity
- A server performing complex calculations may require a fast processor and large memory

The physical components of a server are known as **server hardware**.  
Hardware includes components such as processors, memory, storage devices, and network interfaces.

Hardware is difficult to change because components must be physically replaced.

## Server Software

Once server hardware is installed in a data center, **software** can run on it.

Software:
- Is the code that runs on the server
- Is easy to change or update
- Can be replaced without changing physical components

A simple way to remember this:
- **Hardware** is physical and hard to change
- **Software** is flexible and easy to change

## What Is a Web Server?

A **web server** is a type of server software designed to handle web-related services.

A web server is responsible for:
- Storing website files
- Managing website access
- Handling security
- Managing data and emails
- Responding to web requests

## Web Requests and Responses

When you open a browser and type a website address:
1. Your device (client) sends a **web request**
2. The web server receives the request
3. The server sends back the website content

This process is called the **request–response cycle**.

Web servers are designed to handle **thousands of client requests per second**, ensuring fast and reliable access to websites.

## Conclusion

In summary:
- A server is a computer that provides services to clients
- Servers are hosted in data centers around the world
- Servers consist of both hardware and software
- A web server is specialized software that delivers website content
- One of the main roles of a web server is responding to web requests

This forms the foundation of how websites work on the internet.
