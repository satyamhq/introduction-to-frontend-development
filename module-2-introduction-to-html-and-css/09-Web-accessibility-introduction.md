# Web Accessibility

As a web developer, it’s important to ensure that **everyone can access and enjoy the internet**. Just like an architect designs buildings with ramps and rails so they are usable by everyone, websites should be built in a way that improves accessibility.

Web accessibility is about designing and building websites that people of all abilities can use effectively.

## What Is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility aims to allow people with disabilities to:

* Understand website content
* Navigate web pages
* Interact with web applications

A common misconception is that accessibility only relates to **visual impairments**. In reality, it includes many types of disabilities that affect how people use the web.

These include:

* Visual disabilities
* Hearing (audio) disabilities
* Cognitive and neurological disabilities
* Physical and motor disabilities
* Speech disabilities

## Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)

The **Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)** was launched in **1997** by the organization responsible for web standards.

At its launch, **Sir Tim Berners‑Lee**, the creator of the World Wide Web, stated:

> *“The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.”*

The WAI develops specifications, guidelines, and supporting resources that are considered **international standards** for web accessibility.

## Accessibility as a Requirement

Web accessibility is increasingly becoming a **legal and industry requirement**.

In **2016**, the **European Union** approved the **Web Accessibility Directive**, which requires websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies to be accessible to people with disabilities.

## Assistive Technologies

People with disabilities often rely on **assistive technologies** to browse the web.

### Screen Readers

* Read website content aloud
* Announce page structure and interactions
* Used by blind and visually impaired users
* Also helpful for users with reading or learning difficulties

### Speech Recognition Software

* Converts spoken words into commands or text
* Allows hands-free interaction
* Helpful for users with physical or neurological disabilities

### Subtitles and Transcripts

* Provide access to audio and video content
* Assist users with hearing impairments
* Also helpful in noisy or quiet environments

## Building Accessible Websites

Accessibility should be considered **from the very beginning** of a project. Retrofitting accessibility later is often difficult and time-consuming.

Using the **correct HTML structure and appropriate elements** greatly improves accessibility.

---

## Importance of Proper HTML Structure

Well-structured HTML helps assistive technologies understand and interact with content.

### Good Practices

* Use proper heading tags (`<h1>`–`<h6>`) for structure
* Use paragraph tags (`<p>`) for text content
* Use lists, tables, and form elements correctly

### Poor Practices

* Placing text outside meaningful HTML tags
* Using multiple `<br>` tags for spacing instead of CSS
* Ignoring semantic HTML elements

These practices can create barriers for users who rely on assistive technologies.

---

## Accessibility for Complex Interfaces

Modern websites often include complex and dynamic user interfaces. In these cases, correct HTML alone may not be enough.

To address this, accessibility guidelines include the **Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)** specification.

### ARIA

* Provides additional attributes to improve accessibility
* Helps assistive technologies understand dynamic content
* Commonly used in complex web applications

---

## Key Takeaways

* Web accessibility ensures websites can be used by everyone
* It includes visual, audio, cognitive, physical, and speech disabilities
* Assistive technologies help users interact with the web
* Proper HTML structure improves accessibility
* Accessibility is easier when considered early
* ARIA helps make complex interfaces accessible

By following best practices and thinking inclusively, you can build websites that truly work for everyone 🌍
