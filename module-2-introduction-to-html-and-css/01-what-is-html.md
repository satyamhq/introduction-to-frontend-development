# What Is HyperText Markup Language (HTML)?

When builders begin constructing a building, one of their first tasks is to assemble the frame. No matter the type of building, construction always starts with a strong structural frame. Once in place, this frame guides the rest of the construction process.

In the same way, an HTML document acts as the **framework of a web page**. It provides the basic structure that all other web technologies build upon. HTML uses **tags** and **elements** to organize and define content on the web.

## Origin of HTML

HTML was created by **Sir Tim Berners-Lee**, a physicist who wanted to help researchers around the world share information more efficiently. As part of this effort, he developed HTML along with the first web browser and web server.

The first version of HTML was released in **1991** while he was working at **CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research)**.

## What Does HTML Mean?

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.

* **HyperText**: Text that contains links to other text or resources.
* **Markup**: A system of tags used to structure and describe content.

HTML is a **plain text file** with a defined structure made up of tags and elements. HTML files usually have the `.html` extension.

A common example of an HTML file is the homepage:

```text
index.html
```

## HTML Tags and Elements

An **HTML element** usually consists of:

* An opening tag
* Content
* A closing tag

### Example: Paragraph Element

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

* `<p>` is the opening tag
* `</p>` is the closing tag
* The text between them is the content

---

## Nested Elements

HTML elements can contain other elements. This is called **nesting**.

### Example

```html
<p>This is <i>italic text</i> inside a paragraph.</p>
```

In this example, the `<i>` element is nested inside the `<p>` element.

---

## Self-Closing Elements

Some HTML elements do not require a closing tag. These are known as **self-closing elements**.

### Example: Line Break

```html
<br>
```

or

```html
<br />
```

The `<br>` tag moves the content to a new line.

## HTML Standards

The structure and rules of HTML are defined by official specifications maintained by the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)**. When improvements or changes are made, a new version of HTML is standardized.

The current standard version of HTML is **HTML5**.

## How Browsers Use HTML

Web browsers read HTML documents and display their content on the screen.

Examples:

* `<img>` tells the browser to display an image
* `<p>` tells the browser to display a paragraph

HTML defines **what content** is displayed.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is used to control **how that content looks**.

* It uses tags and elements to organize content
* Elements can be nested or self-closing
* HTML standards are maintained by the W3C
