# What Is HyperText Markup Language (HTML)?

When a team of builders begin constructing a building, one of their key tasks is to assemble the frame. It does not matter what type of building it is; construction always starts with a frame of beams and rafters. Once the frame is in place, it guides the rest of the construction.

In a similar way, if you compare a building to a web page, an HTML document acts like the frame. It provides the basic structure of a web page and is assembled using different components such as tags and elements.

In this lesson, you learned about HTML documents and the difference between HTML tags and HTML elements.

## Origin of HTML

Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist, often thought about how he and his colleagues from around the world could share information. This question led to the development of HTML.

The first web page was created in 1991 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee while working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Along with HTML, the first web browser and web server were also created.

## What Does HTML Mean?

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.

- **Hypertext** refers to text that contains links to other text.
- **Markup** refers to the tags and elements used within a document.

HTML is a text file with a specific structure made up of tags and elements.  
HTML files usually use the `.html` file extension.

For example, the first page of a website is often named:

```text
index.html
